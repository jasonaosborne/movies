## Movies vignette

This is vignette about how to use the omdb API to get information about
movies and tv shows, such as ratings and years and stuff. Remember that
movie “The Nice Guys” when the character kept admonishing his daughter
not to say “and stuff”? That was awesome, as Chris Farley might have
said, rest his soul.

The markdown file that constitutes this vignette that will be viewable
on github will be created using the following command

``` r
rmarkdown::render("movies.Rmd",output_format="github_document",output_file="README.md")
```

(The command above will also appear in a file called something ”
`createREADME.r` “.) \`\`\`
